# MATLAB Laser Control

Laser control classes for MATLAB. 
Currently only SpectraPhysics MaiTai


## Example

Basic low-level control
```
>> MT = maitai('COM1');
>> MT.turnOn
>> MT.openShutter
```

To start the GUI:
```
>> startLaserControl
```

For that to work you will need to edit the settings file created in the SETTINGS directory the first time you run the above command. Simply fill in the laser name and the COM port index to which the laser is connected.
